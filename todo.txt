fix housekeeper/find page

The route http://localhost:3000/find briefly shows the correct content, then quickly turns into a blank white screen.
Please help me diagnose and fix this issue.
üîç Here's what I need you to do:

Check for runtime errors in the browser console or network tab.
Look for issues like:
Suspense or lazy-loaded components failing to load
Incorrect conditional rendering (e.g., rendering null)
Infinite loops or state issues in the Find page component
Errors during API calls that crash the render
Provide clear instructions on how to fix the issue based on the diagnosis.
